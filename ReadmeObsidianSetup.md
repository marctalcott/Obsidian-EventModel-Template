Once you have put cloned this project, you can setup Obsidian.md and import this entire folder as new Vault.

I suggest the following plugin:
- Templater by SilentVoid

The plugin will allow you to use the Templates I put into the Resources/Templates folder. You should go to the Templater Plugin settings and set the Template Path to Resources/Templates so it doesn't show you all the files you own when you want to use a template.
